# First, map the community name (COMMUNITY) into a security name
# (local and mynetwork, depending on where the request is coming
# from):

#       sec.name  source        community
com2sec local     localhost      public
com2sec mynetwork 10.254.0.0/24  public
        
# Second, map the security names into group names:

#               sec.model sec.name
group MyRWGroup v1        local
group MyRWGroup v2c       local
group MyRWGroup usm       local
group MyROGroup v1        mynetwork
group MyROGroup v2c       mynetwork
group MyROGroup usm       mynetwork

# Third, create a view for us to let the groups have rights to:

#        incl/excl subtree mask
view all included  .1      80

# Finally, grant the 2 groups access to the 1 view with different
# write permissions:

#                context sec.model sec.level match read write notif
access MyROGroup \"\"    any       noauth    exact all  none  none
access MyRWGroup \"\"    any       noauth    exact all  all   none
